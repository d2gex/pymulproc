    1) Check .receive return False when nothing is in the queue
    2) Check .send does add successfully elements in the queue when the queue isn't full
    3) check .receive remove the message from the queue when the next available message in the queue is for the client
    requesting it
    4) Check that .receive does not remove a message from the queue when the next available message in the queue is not
    for the the client that request it
    5) Check .send throws an exception when queue is full and not other element can be placed
    6) Check that .receive does count the task to be done properly for both when the passed function return True and
    False.
